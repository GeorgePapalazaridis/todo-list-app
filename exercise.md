### **Exercise 6: Create a To-Do List**

#### **Task Description**:

1. Build a simple to-do list application that allows the user to:
   - Add tasks to the list.
   - Remove individual tasks from the list.
2. The web page should have:
   - An **input field** to type the task.
   - A **button** to add the task.
   - A **list** to display the tasks.
   - Each task should have a **delete button** to remove it.

#### **Requirements**:

- Use **HTML** to create the structure.
- Use **CSS** to style the to-do list (optional, focus on functionality first).
- Use **JavaScript** to handle the add/remove functionality.

#### **Expected Behavior**:

- Clicking the "Delete" button next to a task removes it from the list.
